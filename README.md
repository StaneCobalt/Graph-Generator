# GraphGenerator
### by Stephen Sladek

This program provides an example of how you can use R.Net to create a graph from SQL data in C# using Windows Forms.

In a nutshell, it takes in info from a database (a very simple one for this example), loads that data into R, generates a chart, then saves that chart as a png file.

Dependencies include:
 - R
 - RStudio for Windows
 - RDotNet Community
 - dplyr
 - ggplot2
 - ggthemes
